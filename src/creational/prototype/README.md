# Prototype Design Pattern
### Please support my repo with your star.

## Definition
The Prototype Design Pattern is a creational pattern that allows cloning existing objects without depending on their specific classes. Instead of creating a new instance from scratch, the prototype pattern enables copying an existing object, including its internal state, to produce new objects. This is particularly useful when object creation is expensive, and similar objects are needed frequently with slight variations.

## Example in Real World/Nature Inspired
1. **DNA Cloning:** In biology, organisms reproduce by cloning their DNA. This allows for the creation of new organisms that are nearly identical to the original — a natural example of the prototype concept.
2. **Manufacturing Molds:** In industrial design, a mold (prototype) is used to create identical copies of a product quickly, like plastic parts or metal castings.
3. **Stamping/Seals:** Seals or stamps are used to imprint the same design on documents or materials. The stamp acts as a prototype, replicating the same pattern multiple times.
4. **Baking with Cookie Cutters:** A cookie cutter serves as a prototype to make many cookies of the same shape and size, easily and consistently.

## Real Usage/System Design Problems
1. **Object Creation Cost:** When creating an object is resource-intensive (e.g., loading configuration, fetching data, setting up internal structures), using a prototype to clone a pre-initialized object can significantly improve performance.
2. **Game Development (Enemy or Item Spawning):** In games, multiple similar objects (like enemies or items) are spawned. Using a prototype for each type makes cloning efficient without repeatedly constructing new ones.
3. **UI Element Duplication:** If a user interface requires many similar widgets (like cards or list items), a prototype can be used to duplicate base elements with only minor adjustments, saving time and complexity.

## Important Points of Implementation
- **Clone Method:** The core of this pattern is a cloning method that duplicates the object. This method should ensure deep or shallow copies are handled correctly depending on the object’s structure.
- **Avoid Constructor Logic:** The idea is to bypass costly or complex constructor logic by copying an existing object instead.
- **Deep vs. Shallow Copy:** Pay attention to whether a deep or shallow copy is needed—deep copy duplicates all nested objects, while shallow only copies references.
- **Prototype Registry:** In some implementations, a central registry of prototypes is maintained. New objects are cloned from the registered prototypes, allowing easier management of base templates.
