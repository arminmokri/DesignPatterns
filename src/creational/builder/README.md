# Builder Design Pattern
### Please support my repo with your star.

## Definition
The Builder Design Pattern is a creational pattern that separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations. It provides a step-by-step approach to building objects, especially those that require multiple configuration options or components. The Builder pattern is ideal when creating objects that cannot be built in a single step due to their complexity or variability in construction.

## Example in Real World/Nature Inspired
1. **Building a House:** Different teams (builders) may construct various types of houses—wooden, brick, or prefabricated—following the same steps: laying foundation, building walls, and installing a roof. The final product differs based on the builder's configuration.
2. **Ordering a Custom Meal:** At a restaurant, you can build a burger by choosing a bun, patty, cheese, veggies, and sauces. The builder (chef) assembles it step-by-step based on your selection.
3. **Car Manufacturing Line:** The process of assembling a car involves several steps—installing the chassis, engine, interior, etc.—and the builder can vary these steps to produce different models (SUV, sedan, truck).
4. **DNA Replication in Cells:** Cells replicate DNA using enzymes in a step-by-step process that builds a full strand from smaller parts. Each cell may use the same replication process but can produce slightly varied outcomes due to environment or mutations.

## Real Usage/System Design Problems
1. **Creating Complex Objects (e.g., UI Forms or Reports):** In applications where objects like forms or documents are built from many optional parts, the Builder pattern simplifies the creation process and avoids a telescoping constructor.
2. **Object Construction with Multiple Optional Parameters:** When constructors become overloaded due to many optional parameters, the Builder pattern provides a readable and scalable solution.
3. **Serialization/Deserialization Systems:** In systems where objects are reconstructed from data (e.g., JSON or XML), builders help construct the object piece-by-piece based on available data and logic.

## Important Points of Implementation
- **Director Role (Optional):** A director class may orchestrate the building steps using a specific builder, ensuring a consistent process across different object types.
- **Fluent Interface:** The builder can use a fluent interface for chaining methods, improving readability when constructing complex objects.
- **Immutable Result:** Builders often produce immutable objects by setting all properties during construction and not exposing setters afterward.
- **Separation of Concerns:** The construction logic is separated from the object’s representation, making the codebase cleaner and easier to maintain.
